#Scicoder 2014

This is my repo for Scicoder 2014. 

-----------

Some Observations:
------------------

##Day 1
* I maybe I should learn vi
* macfusion (FUSE) is kinda cool
* You can totally put equations in markdown (may not show on all systems)
$$f(\omega) = sin(\omega - 1)^{w + 1}$$ 
(like github)
* No coffee no snacks = unhappy!


* Use git! It has a learning curve, but it will make you life better. 

-------
* Operator Overloading, that seems fun and maybe dangerous.....
* Stop doing `from foo import *`
