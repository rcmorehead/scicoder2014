#Scicoder 2014

This is my repo for Scicoder 2014. 

-----------

Some Observations:
------------------

##Day 1
* I maybe I should learn vi
* macfusion (FUSE) is kinda cool
* You can totally put equations in markdown (may not show on all systems)
$$f(\omega) = sin(\omega - 1)^{w + 1}$$ 
(like github)
* No coffee no snacks = unhappy!


* Use git! It has a learning curve, but it will make you life better. 

-------
* Operator Overloading, that seems fun and maybe dangerous.....
* Stop doing `from foo import *`
* Singleton - make one unique object that is always the same object no matter how many times you call it. Very handy.......
* Oh yeah, I always forget that sets are a thing

---------
##Day 2
* Objects are fun!
* Numpy!
* Neat trick, you can make bumpy arrays immutable 
	* `array.flags.writeable = False`
* Use numpy functions only on numpy arrays 
* @property decorator can make methods into properties 
* Use 'Lazy Loading' Only load data when you need it, not before. 
* test you code, checkout pytest 
* If you find a bug, add a test for that bug to your test script and then you will spot it if it comes back
*
